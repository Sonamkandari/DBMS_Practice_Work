* **Key-Value Database**
* **Column-Based Database**: An advanced version of a database optimized for analytical queries.

## Types of SQL Commands
 ### DDL commands (Data Defination language command)
 
* Note when at the begining your database is empty and now what have done here is you have defined something new in the database and you used some commands to write create  and alter something in the data base those commands are comes under the DDL commands

* why we  leaning SQL
  1. if you want to talk to the data you should use SQL
  2. High Demand of SQl (Data Analysis)
  3. Industry Standard

* learned about all the basics queries 
* select , where clause, having clause, order by , or Group by

---
* SQL clause
* Having clause
* Filtered Aggregated Data
* having 
* filters Data After Aggregation
* having clause can be used only with Group by

---
## imp
### since we already have where clause to filter the data so why do we use having clause ?
* if you want to filter the data before the aggregation we use WHERE CLAUSE
* if you want to filter the data after the aggregation we use HAVING CLAUSE
